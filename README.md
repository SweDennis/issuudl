Short gawk script to download issuu publications

I found some online services to create .pdf files for an issuu publication, but didn't like having my reading history stored on an external server.
I found some scripts to download images and convert to .pdf, but most I found were either big and cluttered, or required manual input.

So, I decided to roll my own, to scratch my own itch, and gawk was the language of choice, considering the low complexity of the task, and expected low number of rows.

Any and all comments and/or suggestions are appreciated.
